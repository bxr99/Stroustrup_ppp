Q: What are the typical sizes for a 'char', 'int', and 'double'?
A: char - 1 byte (8 bits)
	 int - 4 bytes (32 bits)
	 double - 8 bytes (64 bits)

Q: What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as
	 'ints' and 'strings'?

Q: What is the difference between = and == ?

   's1' are followed by the characters from 's2'.

   string s1 = "Hello";
   string s2 = "World";
   string s3 = s1 + s2; // "HelloWorld"
