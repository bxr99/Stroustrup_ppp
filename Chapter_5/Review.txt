Q: Name four major types of errors and briefly define each one.
A:

Q: What kinds of errors can we ignore in student programs?
A:

Q: What guarantees should every completed project offer?
A:

Q: List three approaches we can take to eliminate errors in programs and produce
   acceptable software.
A: (1) Organize software to minimize errors
   (2) Eliminate most of the errors we made through debugging and testing
   (3) Make sure the remaining errors are not serious

Q: What is a syntax error?  Give five examples.
A: Errors that are not well formed according to the C++ grammar, so the compiler
   will reject them.

   int s1 = area(7;   // error: ) missing
   int s2 = area(7)   // error: ; missing
   Int s3 = area(7);  // error: Int is not a type
   int s4 = area('7); // error: non-terminated character (' missing)

Q: What is a type error?  Give five examples.
A:

Q: What is a linker error?  Give three examples.
A: An error found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into
   an executable program.

Q: What is a logic error?  Give three examples.
A: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.

Q: List four potential sources of program errors discussed in the text.
A:

Q: How do you know if a result is plausible?  What techniques do you have to
   answer such questions?
A:

Q: Compare and contrast having the caller of a function handle a run-time error
   vs. the called function's handling the run-time error.
A:

Q: Why is using exceptions a better idea than returning an "error value"?
A:

Q: How do you test if an input operation succeeded?
A:

Q: Describe the process of how exceptions are thrown and caught.
A:

Q: Why, with a vector called v, is v[v.size()] a range error?  What would be the
   the result of calling this?
A:

Q: Define pre-condition and post-condition; give an example (that is not the area()
   function from this chapter), preferably a computation that requires a loop.
A:

Q: When would you not test a pre-condition?
A:

Q: When would you not test a post-condition?
A:

Q: What are the steps in debugging a program?
A:

Q: Why does commenting help with debugging?
A:

Q: How does testing differ from debugging?
A:
